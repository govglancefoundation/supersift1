# About Super Sift

Super Sift is a next generation privacy search engine. We believe search engines are fundamental technology to the modern world and therefore should not be in controlled by a monopoly of large for profit tech companies. Super Sift is a free and private search engine operated by Gov Glance Foundation Inc. a 501c3 Non-profit organization. The Gov Glance foundation who created [govglance.org](http://govglance.org) believe in free and open access to essential information. The creation of Super Sift was a natural extension of this mission to provide people with better tools for conduction research. Super Sift is a [metasearch engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine) based off of the [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) project which allows users to privately aggregate results from multiple sources including Google, DuckDuckGo, or custom databases. We are building off of this project to provide people with easy to use advanced search techniques.
